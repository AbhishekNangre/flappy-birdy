# 🐦 Flappy Birdy  

A fun little **Flappy Bird clone** built with JavaScript & HTML5 Canvas.  
The rules are simple: keep the bird flying, avoid the pipes, and don’t rage quit (too fast).  

⚠️⚠️ Disclaimer: This is **just a fun project**. ⚠️⚠️
> Don’t expect AAA graphics, flawless physics, or life-changing gameplay.  
> It’s just me, a keyboard, and a bird that refuses to fly properly.
